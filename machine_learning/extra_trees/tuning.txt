n_estimators: number of trees in forest
-> Default: 100
max_features: The number of features to consider when looking for the best split
-> Default: auto
min_samples_split: The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node
-> Default: 2
min_samples_leaf: The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node
-> Default: 1
max_depth: The maximum depth of the tree
-> Default: None (nodes are expanded until all leaves contain less than min_samples_split samples)

n_estimators must be high but cant be too high, otherwise the runtime is too high
best so far is 350

I kept max_features at 0.5 

min_samples_leaf and max_depth on default

Best results with auto min_samples_split -> 10

Best result: MAE: 1.8
n_estimators=350, max_features=auto, min_samples_split=2, min_samples_leaf=1, max_depth=None, random_state=42
